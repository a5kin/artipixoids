  description: This is the very early attempt to write a CA with energy conservation. The engine was very buggy, it even didn't fully comply the conservation principle. Nevertheless, it produced decent pixel art, so I decided to take some screens of it. Only two of them survived, but recently I found the oldest version in my stash, so new shots of <b>Mod 0</b> are on their way.

  description: Since </b>Mod 0</b> I was experimenting a lot with different modifications. None of them had any artistic value though, so they died unborn. Until I was stricken by the idea to add genetic microprograms for each cell. Immediately, they began to play with my imagination, so I made a lot of screenshots and even the very first video showing <b>Artipixoids!</b> in action.

  description: <b>Mod 1</b> was very glitchy and sharp, so I was continuing to improve the engine, in order to make the effects more nature-like. A lot of meta-parameters were added to the engine, bringing physics to the next level. The engine began to show very diversified behavior, but it had a bug, making the evolution non-deterministic, which also resulted in ugly vertical stripes.

  description: This mod was very similar in meta-parameters to the <b>Mod 2</b>, but fully deterministic. Unfortunately, with the deteminicity came different dynamics, and it was worse for my liking.

  description: Finally, after many re-designs I ended up with the most wonderful 2-dimensional modification. There is some real PRNG magic in it, and I am not sure myself how exactly it works :) But the one thing is important, the images it produces are <a target="_blank" href="mod2c.html">mind-blowing</a>.
