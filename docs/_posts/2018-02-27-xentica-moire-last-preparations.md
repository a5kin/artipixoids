We are doing last preparations before first [**Xentica**][1]
release. Actually, it is already fully prepared to be released. It has
a solid documentation, covered 100% by tests, and setup script is
ready too. The only thing left is to publish the package at PyPI.

But along with **Xentica** we also have to release [**Moire**][2],
since they are closely connected. And **Moire** is in a bit far from
release state. So, in order to publish both packages simultaneously,
first we have to document **Moire** and write at least some
tests. Some refactoring and integration with CI systems are desirable
too.

Hopefully, it will not take a lot of time, cause **Moire** is much
smaller package in comparison to **Xentica**.
