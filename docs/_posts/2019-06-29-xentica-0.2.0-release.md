Good day, the next major version is out at last, and we are glad to
present you [Xentica 0.2.0][1] release. A lot of new features were
added to the core engine. And the good news, it's backward compatible
with the previous version, so you could upgrade safely.

The main goal accomplished, we built the [EvoLife model][3] purely with
Xentica. The structures with the most interesting dynamics (so-called
'Bliambas') are achievable with it, although with a bit different
meta-parameters. You could check how it runs on a [demo
video][5]. Another interesting stable ecosystem was discovered in the
process of development, [video][6] is available. Both experiments shot
on those videos are included in the official [EvoLife example][3], you
could always reproduce them yourself.

Also, there is an experiment with EvoLife modification in 6D, but you
should have a powerful video card with at least 9GB RAM in order to
run it. And even with GTX 1080Ti, it runs very slow (~7FPS). If you
are interested, check the glitchy [time-lapse video][7] of this
experiment.

In order to make run all the things described above, we had to
implement a number of new features to the core engine:

- **Per-cell RNG property**. If specified, each cell will have a separate
  pseudo-random stream, with the ability to draw direct integer values
  and values from the uniform distribution.
  
- **Dynamic totalistic rule property**. This is a regular integer property
  with the encoded lifelike/totalistic rule. It could also easily
  test a cell for born / dead status.

- **Genome crossover**. It helps you to crossover several genomes in
  a stochastic way, bit by bit. Also, has an option to mutate a gene
  with a certain probability.

- **Meta-parameters**. Constants that could be changed per each
  experiment. Makes experimenting more convenient, since you could
  easily inherit and re-use them.
  
- **Interactive parameters**. A special meta-parameters case, that could
  be changed in runtime. It would be useful for the values you control
  interactively, like render options or mutation probability.

- **Math functions**. A collection of functions, mapping to C
  counterparts. ``min``/``max``, typecasting and so on.
  
- **Genome coloring**. A collection of algorithms helping your
  evolutionary models to look just awesome out of the box.
  
A solid part of the work also done to make the testing process super
easy and informative. Now, we have a powerful [test suite][8], managed
by a single ``tox`` command. It will:

- run tests in all supported Python environments;
- do sanity checks for the build;
- test how docs are building;
- run code style checks;
- do code static analysis;
- build code coverage;
- run a benchmark.

As well, almost all major bugs were fixed, except the [new one][9] with
``DeferredExpression`` as an initial value for ``Variable``.

You could check the full list of changes for this version in the
[CHANGELOG][4].

As in the previous release, no changes were made for [Moire][2], you
can safely use 0.1.0 with the latest [Xentica][1]. Although, we found
[several bugs][10] for cases when the frame rate is too low. They
gonna be fixed along with the next Xentica release.

Now, for future plans. As the main goal, we'll focus on a Stochastic
Corrector (or [alike][11]) model in the next version. Most probably,
it will be a bugfix release (0.2.1), since we already have all the
necessary features to implement it. But, there is also a couple of
features in the backlog that would be necessary. If so, we'll skip to
the next major (0.3) version.

Traditionally, there are performance results, in gigacells per second:

| GPU | Tester | Conway's Life | Shifting Sands | Noise TV | EvoLife
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| **GTX 1080Ti** | [@a5kin][93] | 6.38 Gcells/s | 7.25 Gcells/s | 7.33 Gcells/s | 1.31 Gcells/s

If you wish to extend this table, please send your own results, along
with your GPU model. You could run the benchmark with the ``tox -e
benchmark`` command.
