Today is the anniversary of both [**Xentica**][1] and [**Moire**][2],
a year since the development started. On this day, we are glad to
present you the first public release of the system.

Version 0.1.0 is a minimum viable product. The main goal was to make
[Game Of Life model][3] runnable with **Xentica/Moire** ecosystem. We
succeed with it, and in the process, some cool extra features were
implemented, like multi-dimensionality and multiple properties per
cell. See the full list of features in the [Xentica Changelog][4].

**Moire** is a mere satellite of **Xentica**, but also has its own
standalone example, called [Noise TV][5]. Current functionality is
very minimal, you can see the detailed description in [Moire
Changelog][6].

The system was tested on Debian/Ubuntu only, [installation instructions][7]
are included. If you'll manage to run it on other OS, please
[update us][8] with details/hints.

There are also a number of bugs and optimization issues we are going to
fix in 0.1.x releases. Then, we will focus on version 0.2.0, the main
goal of which is to run [Evolife][9] with **Xentica/Moire**.
