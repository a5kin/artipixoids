High fives, if you did not notice, [Xentica 0.2][1] active development just started this week. We have a primary goal to

* run [Evolife][2] model on the renewed **Xentica** engine

And the secondary goals are:

* integrate meta-params with [Moire][3] for automated UI build
* give the ability to edit those params interactively
* save/load experiments at runtime

Hopefully, most of those changes would be done before the **Xentica** 2nd anniversary (May 5th).

There are more things to be done for real-life science application, as we discussed with [@Arcprotorp][4] in [Artipixoids utility in Origin of Life research][5] issue.

So, probably we could sacrifice secondary goals (dealing most with visual/usability stuff) in favor of early core features, like: *fields*, *distributions* and other *tools* necessary to run **Xentica** powered version of [MSE][6] or similar model.

**Moire** itself would most likely stay at 0.1 version, giving us just basic visualisation abilities. We'll proceed to automated UI generation only after **Xentica 0.2** is released. 

Traditionally, we have an updated performance results. Author's shining new **GTX 1080Ti**, and another **GTX 1050Ti** version by [@Arcprotorp][4] were added.
