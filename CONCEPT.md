# Artipixoids!: The Concept (draft)

> 2D body, 2D brain,  
> 2D pleasure, 2D pain.

Artipixoids are subpixel agents, who are living in constantly evolving 2D world:
moving, breeding, feeding, dying, etc. The goal is to create an artificial
world with universal rules for each pixel, then let them to evolve, communicate,
and self-organize into complex creatures.
