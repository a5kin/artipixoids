# Artipixoids!: The Concept (draft)

> 2D body, 2D brain,  
> 2D pleasure, 2D pain.

**Artipixoids!** is half generative art, half artificial life project with a focus on genetic cellular automata obeying energy conservation principle. Started in the end of 2014, it has undergone several major modifications, and is still in development. But now is the right time to share basic concepts underlying all previous modifications, so others could use it to build their own wonderful worlds. 

## Main goals

1. **Artistic**

1.1. We are going to generate the beautiful objects of abstract digital arts, even at the cost of computational resources. 

1.2. The objects of arts are: static images, videos, sound, 3D models, etc.

1.3. We will consider the object as Artipixoid if and only if:

- the object is generated by CA fulfilling all the items from Basic Rules section (thus, inherited from it);
- the object's generative algorithm is not using anything but CA states as input;
- the object's generative algorithm is not based on the objects of arts, other than Artipixoids (eg. deep art based on Van Gogh paintings or photos doesn't count, but deep art based on other Artipixoids is OK).

1.4 Artipixoids that has no artistic value are bad and a subject to genocide. 

1.5 Yet, if at least one person found them beautiful, we let them live.
